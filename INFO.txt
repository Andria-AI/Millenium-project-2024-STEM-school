# Electrostatically Driven Fog Collection Using Space Charge Injection

## Overview
This research presents a novel approach to fog collection by leveraging electrostatic forces to enhance water droplet capture efficiency. Traditional fog collectors, which rely on inertial collision with mesh structures, are limited by aerodynamic drag. The proposed method introduces an ion emitter to charge fog droplets and uses an electric field to direct them toward a collector, significantly improving collection efficiency.

## Key Contributions
- **Innovative Mechanism**: Utilizes corona discharge to inject a net charge into fog droplets, enabling their controlled movement via an electric field.
- **Enhanced Efficiency**: Demonstrates that electrostatic forces can overcome aerodynamic drag, achieving higher collection rates compared to passive mesh-based systems.
- **Scalable Design**: Provides insights into optimizing wire configurations, mesh designs, and operating voltages for practical fog harvesting applications.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Operates at low power (~40 W/m²), making it a viable solution for water-scarce regions and industrial applications like cooling tower plume recovery.

## Applications
- **Water Scarcity Solutions**: Ideal for drought-prone coastal areas with regular fog.
- **Industrial Use**: Potential for recovering water from power plant cooling towers.
- **Visibility Improvement**: Could be adapted for fog removal systems in airports and on roads.

## Technical Details
- **Experimental Setup**: Involves a high-voltage ion emitter and grounded collector to create an electric field for droplet capture.
- **Performance Metrics**: Collection efficiency is quantified using nondimensional parameters like the electrical number (Ke), Stokes number (St), and spacing saturation (D*).
- **Results**: Achieves deposition efficiencies exceeding 2, significantly higher than traditional methods.
