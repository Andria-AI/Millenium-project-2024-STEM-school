as we know traditional water collection/filtartion methods used in dry areas are generaly expensive,hard to manifacture,not so great for enviorment and generaly unefective compeared to water outputs.
our take to as team of four high school students and our mentor is to solve this problem by introducing corona discharge into condensation system. in MIT study:Damak, Maher, and Kripa K. Varanasi. “Electrostatically Driven Fog Collection Using
Space Charge Injection.” Science Advances 4, no. 6 (June 2018): eaao5323. it is explained proofed and tested by highly proffesional reasearchers that introducing corona charges into fog,steam and highly humid areas greatly increases condesantion levels.more on that in INFO.txt file or MIT study itself.
